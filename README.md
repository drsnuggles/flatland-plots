## Description ##

A couple of scripts to help inhabitants of Spaceland imagine the two-dimensional world as described in [Edwin Abbott's Flatland] [1]. All view-points are initaliazed to the viewpoint of an inhabitant of Flatland.

## Usage ##

Just do 'python woman.py' or 'python noble.py' and the view *should* initialize to what inhabitants of Flatland see. Use mouse to move viewpoint.

Needs:
  - Python and matplotlib (at least v1.0). So far only tested with Python 2.7.3 and matplotlib 1.2.1.

## TODO ##

1) Fogginess (i.e., depth perception - this enables inhabitants of Flatland to distinguish the other's class from afar).  
2) Would be neat if I could restrict the legal mouse-movement of the user - i.e., to force the user to stay in 2D and turn off the Z-axis when moving.  
3) Add more different inhabitants  
4) also needs a reason why I did this
